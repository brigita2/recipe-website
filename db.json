Elise lived for a time in New England, as well as Japan, and her sweetheart is a dashing Frenchman from Provence, so you’ll find cuisines from those areas reflected in her recipes as well. lise’s recipes use mostly whole food ingredients, and only occasionally a few things from cans or prepared foods.

        "secondParagraph": "Simply Recipes was founded in 2003 by Elise Bauer as a home cooking blog to record her favorite family recipes. Today, Simply Recipes has grown into a trusted resource for home cooks with more than 3,000 tested recipes, guides, and meal plans, drawing over 15 million readers each month from around the world.

      },
      "ourHistory": "Elise Bauer was a busy Silicon Valley executive when she became sick with a flu that wouldn’t go away in 2001. In 2003, Elise moved home with her parents and lived with them for several years, recovering from chronic fatigue and documenting her parents’ cooking on Simply Recipes. (Here’s more of that story.) Over the years, what started as a small blog grew to reach millions of readers every month! In 2020, Simply Recipes was acquired by Dotdash Meredith, a New York-based media company.",
      "recipeDevelopment": "Our recipes primarily use fresh, unprocessed ingredients but we also believe there is a time and a place for canned, frozen, and other prepared ingredients. We believe in a diet that includes a wide variety of foods: real butter and cream, extra virgin olive oil, eggs, lots of fruits and vegetables, and protein from meat, fish, beans, and cheese. Plus cake for dessert.",
